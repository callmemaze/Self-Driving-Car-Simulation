# Self-Driving-Car-Simulation

# Autonomous Car üöò üõ£Ô∏è

## Inspiration üóº

1) [Udacity Self driving car](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)
2) [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

## Code Requirements ü¶Ñ
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

`pip install requirements.txt`

## Gathering Data

For gathering the data‚Äôs, I have used Udacity Self Driving Car Simulator. It was originally built for Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. This simulator was built with Unity, and it was recently open sourced by Udacity so anybody can take advantage for training the model for clone driving behavior. It replicates the original Nvidia simulation.

## Run the model

Start up [the Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

`python simulation.py`
